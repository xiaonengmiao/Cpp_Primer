##Exercise 1.1 

> Review the documentation for your compiler and determine what file naming convention it uses. Compile and run the main program from page 2.

##Exercise 1.2 

> Change the program to return -1. A return value of -1 is often treated as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and rerun your program to see how your system treats a failure indicator from main.

##Exercise 1.3

> Write a program used to print Hello, World on the standard output.

##Exercise 1.4

> Our program used the addition, +, to add two numbers. Write a program that uses the multiplication operator, *, to print each operand.

##Exercise 1.5

> We wrote the output in one large statement. Rewrite the program to use a separate statement to print each operand.

##Exercise 1.6

> Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.

```cpp
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
          << " and " << v2;
	  << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
```
> If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How would you fix it?
